Street Art Finder



Have you ever been walking through your neighborhood, or travelling in a new city, and noticed an incredible piece of street art that told a really meaningful story about its surroundings? State of the Art is a mobile app that lets you share it with the world, and discover beautiful street art near your current location. It was inspired by personal experiences traveling to unfamiliar cities, and learning as much about the culture and people from art on the street as I did in museums.
